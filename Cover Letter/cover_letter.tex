To Whom It May Concern,

\hspace{36pt}
My name is Spencer Delcore and I am applying for the position of Wireless Sensor Engineer for the Spring of 2017. I am currently a third year student in Computer Engineering. I previously completed four co-op jobs, each at a different company in various stages of the business life cycle. These opportunities have allowed me to gain practical experience on the business and the technology side of each company. By applying my communication, problem-solving, and technical skills, I believe I would be a strong asset to the University of Waterloo.

\hspace{36pt}
My introduction to working in the technology field was in the winter of 2015, while working for Emerging Star Investment Group, a SaaS start-up company based in Waterloo. As the only person on their technical team, I was quickly given full responsibility of all projects and infrastructure. I developed my communication skills while preparing and presenting all major decisions and progress to groups who were not proficient in the field. In the summer of 2016, while working for Ingle International, I was able to further hone my communication skills. While working together as a team of developers, we ensured deadlines and project specifications were met successfully and completed despite short timeframes.

\hspace{36pt}
I have experience with many aspects of technology, such as full stack development for both web and mobile devices, embedded systems, and creating infrastructures for both personal and professional use. Having such broad experience, I am able to adapt to any situation without being overwhelmed. When placed outside of my expertise, I employ every available resource to meet and exceed expectations. I enjoy facing new challenges and being able to apply my learnings. I understand that not all problems require the same approach. I am willing to investigate and develop new solutions, and improve on existing ones.

\hspace{36pt}
Building on my experience in development, I am excited to participate in the development being done in the Faculty of Engineering. I hope to learn from the University of Waterloo's vast technological expertise while also contributing to the University of Waterloo's history of success. I believe that working with the University of Waterloo will complement my experience, skills, and educational trajectory.

\hspace{36pt}
Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Spencer Delcore
